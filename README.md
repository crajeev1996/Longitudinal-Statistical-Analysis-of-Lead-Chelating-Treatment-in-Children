# Longitudinal-Statistical-Analysis-of-Lead-Chelating-Treatment-in-Children
This project aims to ascertain the efficacy of a Lead Chelating treatment in reducing the blood lead levels of children exposed to lead due to lead based paint prevalent in the U.S during the 1970s. Three treatments were analyzed, a Placebo, a Low Dosage and a High Dosage. 

Various mixed effects General Linear Models were developed in R for our analysis. A variety of fixed effects and Random effects were considered and a succinct reduced model was developed for statistical inferences. For error correlation, various covariance structures such as Compound Symmetry, Unstructed Covariance and Auto-regressive lag 1 were tried and evaluated.
